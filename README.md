# TDT4215_Recommender-Systems

The objective of this project is to develop three distinct recommender systems, including a collaborative system, a content-based system, and a sequence predictor utilizing BERT. To run the project, it is recommended to create a Python environment to keep track of installed requirements. Below you can find the instructions on how to run the project.
To begin, ensure that Anaconda Powershell is installed, then open an Anaconda command tool and navigate to the cloned repository. The next step is to make an environment using the commands below. 

```
conda create -n tdt4215 python=3.9
conda activate tdt4215
```

Now that you have an environment, you can install the requirements for the project by using this command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The system code has been implemented in Jupyter Notebook. To proceed, simply execute the various code blocks contained within the Notebook.
